## Instructions

Continue working on the functionality of your `sales.html` page if you do not have it working 100% yet, including the
row of totals across the bottom.

Add detailed information for each location to the home page, dynamically rendered from the array of location objects
you've been using in the application.

Feel free to make this information up. Get creative, have fun, but remember to be professional.

Run your Lighthouse Accessibilty report. We are looking for a score between 65-80. Analyze the report to see what
changes you can make to your site that will improve your score. Add a screenshot of your score to your README.md.

### Stretch Goals

- Pat has provided you 7 additional images that they would like to see on the home page of the site as rotated images in
  the "Hero" section.
  - These images are located in your daily class GitHub repo: `class-08/lab-b/assets/`.
- Add the ability for your users to switch between a "light" and "dark" mode for the page.
  - Clicking a button should allw them to toggle between modes
- Document and publish a style guide, using
  either [Starbucks React Components Pattern Library](https://www.starbucks.com/developer/pattern-library/guidelines/)
  or [Starbucks - High level Guide](https://creative.starbucks.com/) as a model.
- Make two additional pages, using our template as a guide:
  - Mock up an order form that would be public facing (**store.html**) so that visitors to the website can order salmon
    cookies and swag. That form would need to receive all of the things you'd expect on an order form: name, address,
    payment info, products to order, quantities, special instructions, and so on.
  - A second 'private' page (**order-processing.html**) that shows a list of pending orders and the individual order
    details. The business owner can then process the orders by clicking a button next to the order that then moves that
    list item to a 'Filled Orders' list at the bottom of the page.
