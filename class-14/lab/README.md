# Lab: Data Storage, Retrieval, and Charting

Read the document in its entirety before beginning your lab.

## Problem Domain

The design team has decided to extract the chart from the voting page and move it to a separate results page on the website. We will need to create a new page for the chart, link to it, and then have that page generate the chart, using the voting data from the main page.

At any time, a user should be able to revisit the chart page and see the last set of voting results.

## Instructions

When available, your instructor will pair you with a partner for this lab. Create a new repo using [this template repository](https://github.com/codefellows/201-lab-14){:target="_blank"}.

If partnered with another student:

1. Add the other person as a collaborator. That means that both of you will have privileges to push and merge to that repo.
1. Plan and develop the necessary code in the JavaScript and CSS files, but **do not modify the HTML files in any way**.
1. The `index.html` is where the users will be voting on the items.
1. The `chart.html` page will display the voting results using Chart.js.
1. The `css/styles.css` file, which is currently empty, will house your design and styles for this application.

### Tips

Here are some things to think about as you go plan out the lab for today:

- You'll need to use local storage to share data between the two HTML pages.
- If in a pair, you and your partner should plan out how you want to collaboratively attack the problem with regards to pair programming. It's up to you how the details are managed, but make sure each partner makes contributions in both CSS and JS files.
- Complete the `//TODO` items in the order that works best for you.
- Make small changes, and test them as you go.

### In a nutshell

- Complete all `TODO` items in the JavaScript files.
- Give the app some style.
- Deploy the app.
- Do ****NOT**** modify the html files.
